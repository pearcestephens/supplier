# 🔍 COMPREHENSIVE SITE ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS

Since I don't have direct browser access or screenshot tools, I've created **two powerful testing scripts** that will analyze every aspect of your supplier portal:

---

## 📋 What I Created For You

### 1. `test-comprehensive.sh` - Full Functionality Test
**Tests:** All pages, APIs, security, assets, content

### 2. `test-browser-simulation.sh` - Link Crawler & Analyzer  
**Simulates:** Clicking every link, testing every endpoint, extracting all data

---

## 🚀 How To Run The Tests

### Step 1: Prepare the Scripts

```bash
# Navigate to supplier directory
cd /home/master/applications/jcepnzzkmj/public_html/supplier

# Make scripts executable
chmod +x test-comprehensive.sh
chmod +x test-browser-simulation.sh
```

### Step 2: Get Your Session Token

**Option A - From Browser:**
1. Visit `https://staff.vapeshed.co.nz/supplier/`
2. Open DevTools (F12) → Application tab → Cookies
3. Copy the `session_token` value

**Option B - From Magic Link:**
1. Generate magic link with: `?supplier_id=YOUR_UUID`
2. Visit the link to create session
3. Extract cookie as above

### Step 3: Edit Script Configuration

```bash
# Edit test-comprehensive.sh
nano test-comprehensive.sh

# Find these lines and update:
SESSION_TOKEN="abc123xyz..."       # Paste your session token
SUPPLIER_ID="your-uuid-here..."    # Paste your supplier UUID

# Save and exit (Ctrl+X, Y, Enter)

# Do the same for test-browser-simulation.sh
nano test-browser-simulation.sh
```

### Step 4: Run Comprehensive Test

```bash
# This tests all functionality
./test-comprehensive.sh

# Expected output:
# - HTTP status codes for all pages
# - JSON validation for all APIs
# - Security checks
# - Asset loading verification
# - Pass/Fail summary with percentages
```

### Step 5: Run Browser Simulation

```bash
# This simulates clicking through the entire site
./test-browser-simulation.sh

# This will:
# - Visit every page
# - Extract all links
# - Test all API endpoints
# - Save HTML responses
# - Save JSON responses
# - Generate analysis report
```

### Step 6: Review Results

```bash
# Check the test results directory
ls -lh test_results/

# View the analysis report
cat test_results/ANALYSIS_REPORT.md

# Check individual page responses
cat test_results/dashboard_response.html

# Check API responses
cat test_results/api_dashboard-stats.json | jq .
```

**Fix:** Check supplier_id is correct and has data in database

**Issue:** SQL errors in responses  
**Fix:** Already fixed in our session! Should not happen.

**Fix:** Check assets/ directory exists and files are uploaded

**Issue:** "Fatal error: require_once" messages  
**Fix:** Check bootstrap.php path, verify all includes exist

## 📝 Quick Commands Reference

```bash
# Full test suite
./test-comprehensive.sh

# Browser simulation with link extraction
./test-browser-simulation.sh

# Quick API test (single endpoint)
curl -b "session_token=YOUR_TOKEN" \
  https://staff.vapeshed.co.nz/supplier/api/dashboard-stats.php | jq .

# Test specific page
curl -I -b "session_token=YOUR_TOKEN" \
  https://staff.vapeshed.co.nz/supplier/dashboard.php

# Watch error logs during testing
tail -f logs/apache_*.error.log
```

---

## 🎉 Next Steps After Testing

1. **Run both test scripts**
2. **Review test_results/ directory**
3. **Check ANALYSIS_REPORT.md**
4. **Fix any failures (if any)**
5. **Run tests again to verify fixes**
6. **Share results with team**
7. **Deploy to production!**

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

- Run tests **during low-traffic periods** to avoid affecting real users
- Run tests **before and after changes** to catch regressions
- Save test results with **date stamps** for comparison over time
- Integrate scripts into **CI/CD pipeline** for automated testing
- Use **curl's --trace-ascii** flag for deep debugging if needed
