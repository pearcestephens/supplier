```

### 2. Deploy
Files are already in place - no deployment needed!

### 3. Test
Visit dashboard and verify all elements load correctly.

### 4. Monitor
```bash
# Watch error logs for 5 minutes
tail -f logs/apache_*.error.log
```

## 📞 If Issues Occur

### SQL Errors
- Check `logs/apache_*.error.log`
- Look for "Unknown column" or "Unknown table"
- Verify column name against `_kb/02-DATABASE-SCHEMA.md`

### 500 Errors
- Check PHP error logs
- Verify syntax with `php -l filename.php`
- Check for missing includes

### AJAX Not Loading
- Open browser console (F12)
- Check Network tab for failed requests
- Verify API returns 200 status
- Check response is valid JSON

### Empty Data
- Verify supplier_id is set in session
- Check database has data for this supplier
- Verify SQL WHERE clauses include supplier_id filter
