## ✅ What Was Done

### 1. **Reordered Sidebar Widgets**
- **Recent Activity** now appears FIRST (middle of sidebar)
- **Quick Stats** now appears AT BOTTOM (as requested)

The Recent Activity section now pulls from **5 different sources**:

#### **Source 1: Order Events**
- New orders created
- Order status changes (processing, delivered, partial, cancelled)
- Icon: 🛒 shopping-cart, 🚛 truck, ✅ check-circle, ⚠️ exclamation-triangle
- Examples:
  - "New Order JCE-PO-12345" (blue, shopping cart icon)

  - "Order JCE-PO-12345 processing" (cyan, truck icon)

#### **Source 2: Warranty Claims**
- New warranty claims submitted
- Claims accepted/approved
- Claims declined
- Icon: 🔧 wrench, ✅ check, ❌ times
- Examples:
  - "Warranty claim #789 submitted" (orange, wrench icon)
  - "Warranty claim #789 approved" (green, check icon)
  - "Warranty claim #789 declined" (red, times icon)

#### **Source 3: Notes Added**

- ✅ **Reference** - Order ID or warranty claim ID

**Display Logic:**
- Top 5 most recent activities across ALL sources
- Sorted by timestamp (newest first)
- Auto-refreshes every 2 minutes
- Hover effect for interactivity

### 4. **Visual Improvements**

- `.sidebar-activity-item` - Hover effect, proper spacing
- `.activity-dot` - Colored dots when no icon
- `.activity-text` - Text layout and typography
- `.sidebar-widget-title` - Icons in section headers
- Smooth transitions and animations

**Color Coding:**
- 🔵 **Primary (Blue)** - New orders, tracking updates
- 🟢 **Success (Green)** - Delivered orders, approved warranties

## ✅ Technical Details

### Activity Query Logic

```php
// Collect from 5 sources
$allActivities = [];

// SOURCE 1: Orders (10 most recent)
// SOURCE 2: Warranties (10 most recent)
// SOURCE 3: Notes (10 most recent)
// SOURCE 4: Tracking (10 most recent)
// SOURCE 5: Future sources...

// Merge all activities
usort($allActivities, by timestamp DESC);

// Take top 5
$topActivities = array_slice($allActivities, 0, 5);
```

### Icon Mapping

```javascript
// Icons by activity type
'order' → 'shopping-cart', 'truck', 'check-circle', etc.
'warranty' → 'wrench', 'check', 'times'
'note' → 'comment'
'tracking' → 'box'
```

### Color Coding

```javascript
// Colors by status
'OPEN' → 'primary' (blue)
'SENT/RECEIVING' → 'info' (cyan)
'RECEIVED' → 'success' (green)
'PARTIAL' → 'warning' (orange)
'CANCELLED' → 'danger' (red)
```
