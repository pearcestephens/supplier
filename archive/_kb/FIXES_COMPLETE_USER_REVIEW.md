  -H "Cookie: YOUR_SESSION_COOKIE"

# Should return:
# {"success": true, "data": {...}, "message": "...", "timestamp": "..."}

## 🚨 Known Issues (Non-Critical)

1. **api/v2/ duplicates:** Working files exist in both api/ and api/v2/. Need to decide which to keep.
2. **Export files:** download-*.php and export-*.php not yet reviewed for standardization (may not need JSON responses).
3. **MySQLi/PDO mix:** Some files still use MySQLi, some use PDO. Need full migration to PDO.
4. **No CSRF protection:** Forms lack CSRF tokens (medium priority).
5. **Limited test coverage:** No automated tests yet.
