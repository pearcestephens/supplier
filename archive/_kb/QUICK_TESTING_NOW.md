## ✅ Test Now (5 Minutes)

### 1. Check Error Log First
```bash
tail -100 logs/php_errors.log
```

**Expected:** NO new "Unknown column" or "ambiguous" errors  
**If you see errors:** Tell me the exact error message

### 2. Load Dashboard
```
URL: https://staff.vapeshed.co.nz/supplier/dashboard.php
```

**Expected:**
- ✅ Page loads (no 500 error)
- ✅ White header bar visible at top
- ✅ Gray sub-header bar below it
- ✅ Black sidebar visible on left
- ✅ 6 metric cards show numbers

**If 500 error:** Check error log and tell me the error

### 3. Click Each Nav Link

**Sidebar Navigation:**
```
Dashboard → Should load ✅
Orders → Should load with order list ✅
Warranty → Should load with claims ✅
Downloads → Should load ✅
Reports → Should load ✅
Account → Should load ✅
```

**If any page shows 500:** Tell me which page

### 4. Verify Headers Visible

**Should see:**
- White bar at very top (with logo/supplier name)
- Gray bar below it (with page title)
- Black sidebar on left (with navigation links)

**If headers invisible:** Take screenshot, check browser console (F12)

---

## 📊 Expected Data Behavior

### Dashboard Metrics

**These should have REAL numbers:**
- Total Orders → Actual count from database
- Active Products → Actual count
- Pending Claims → Actual count

**These are PLACEHOLDER (temporary):**
- Avg Order Value → Shows $1,250 (hardcoded)
- Units Sold → Estimated (Total Orders × 25)
- Revenue → Estimated calculation

**Empty sections (JavaScript disabled):**
- Orders Requiring Action table → Empty for now
- Charts → Empty for now
- Stock Alerts → Empty for now

**This is NORMAL** - We disabled JavaScript API calls until backend verified working

## 🔧 Next Actions Based on Results

### If ALL Tests Pass ✅
**Phase A Complete!**

Next steps:
1. **Verify schema** (10 min):
   ```sql
   DESCRIBE purchase_order_line_items;
   ```
   Tell me the column names you see

2. **Update with real data** (15 min):
   Replace placeholder metrics with real calculations

3. **Re-enable JavaScript** (2 min):
   Uncomment API calls in dashboard

4. **Phase B: Eliminate tabs folder** (45 min):
   Merge all tab files into main pages

### If Pages Show 500 Errors ❌
**Tell me:**
1. Which page(s) error
2. Exact error from logs/php_errors.log
3. Browser console errors (F12 → Console tab)

I'll fix immediately.

### If Headers Invisible ❌
**Check:**
1. Browser console (F12) for JavaScript errors
2. View page source - do you see header HTML?
3. CSS loading? Check Network tab in DevTools

### If Data Shows 0 ❌
**Check:**
1. Are you logged in as correct supplier?
2. Does this supplier have orders in database?
3. Error log shows any warnings?

**Current Status:** ✅ Code Fixed, Ready for Testing  
**Your Action:** Test the 4 steps above (5 minutes)
