-- FIX REMAINING MIGRATION ISSUES
-- ============================================================================
-- Purpose: Fix the 2 remaining issues from full migration
-- Date: October 21, 2025
-- Issues to Fix:
--   1. Columns already exist (skip if duplicate error)
--   2. Test faulty product failed (store_location was NULL)
-- ============================================================================

-- ============================================================================
-- ISSUE 1: Skip if columns already exist (use ALTER TABLE IF NOT EXISTS)
-- ============================================================================
-- Note: MariaDB doesn't support IF NOT EXISTS for columns, so we'll use a workaround

-- Check if columns exist before adding
SET @expected_delivery_exists = (
    SELECT COUNT(*) 
    FROM information_schema.COLUMNS 
    WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = DATABASE()
      AND TABLE_NAME = 'transfers'
      AND COLUMN_NAME = 'expected_delivery_date'
);

-- Only add if doesn't exist
SET @sql_add_expected_delivery = IF(
    @expected_delivery_exists = 0,
    'ALTER TABLE `transfers` 
     ADD COLUMN `expected_delivery_date` DATE NULL DEFAULT NULL 
       COMMENT "Expected delivery date set by supplier via portal"
       AFTER `created_at`,
     ADD INDEX `idx_expected_delivery` (`expected_delivery_date`, `state`)',
    'SELECT "Column expected_delivery_date already exists - skipping" as status'
);

EXECUTE stmt;
DEALLOCATE PREPARE stmt;

-- ISSUE 2: Fix Test Faulty Product Insert
-- ============================================================================
-- Problem: @test_store variable was NULL because store name didn't match
-- Solution: Use proper store location value or skip if no match

-- Get a valid Auckland store with proper NULL check
SET @test_store_id = (
    SELECT id FROM vend_outlets 
    WHERE (name LIKE '%Auckland%' OR physical_city LIKE '%Auckland%')
    AND deleted_at = '0000-00-00 00:00:00'
    LIMIT 1
);

-- Get the store name
SET @test_store_name = (
    SELECT name FROM vend_outlets 
    WHERE id = @test_store_id
    LIMIT 1
);

-- Get a VUSE product from British American Tobacco
SET @test_product_id = (
    SELECT id FROM vend_products 
    WHERE supplier_id = '0a91b764-1c71-11eb-e0eb-d7bf46fa95c8'
    AND (name LIKE '%VUSE%' OR name LIKE '%Vuse%')
    AND deleted_at = '0000-00-00 00:00:00'
    LIMIT 1
);

-- Only insert if we have both valid product and store
-- NOTE: faulty_products table does NOT have related_type/related_id columns
-- Those columns are only in supplier_portal_notifications table
INSERT INTO `faulty_products` (
    product_id,
    serial_number,
    fault_desc,
    staff_member,
    store_location,
    time_created,
    status,
    supplier_status,
