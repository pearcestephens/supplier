## 💡 KEY DECISIONS MADE

1. **Products Page Strategy**
   - Decision: Full rebuild rather than patch
   - Rationale: Placeholder was completely broken, rebuild provided opportunity to add real value
   - Result: Suppliers now have product performance analytics

2. **Security Approach**
   - Decision: Dual verification for warranty updates
   - Rationale: Prevent cross-supplier data tampering
   - Result: Warranty claims now secured by supplier_id verification

3. **API Design**
   - Decision: Create separate API endpoints for validation
   - Rationale: Keep business logic separate from presentation
   - Result: Reusable, testable, maintainable code

4. **Documentation Strategy**
   - Decision: Create 5 separate documents for different audiences
   - Rationale: Different people need different levels of detail
   - Result: Executive summary for managers, technical details for developers, testing guide for QA, deployment checklist for DevOps
