## 🔄 DEPLOYMENT PROCESS

### Step 1: Backup Current Production
```bash
# Create date-stamped backup
mkdir -p /backups/production/$(date +%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S)
cp -r /supplier /backups/production/$(date +%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S)/
echo "Backup created: $(date +%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S)"
```

### Step 2: Deploy New Files
```bash
# Deploy modified files
cp /tmp/products.php /supplier/products.php
cp /tmp/dashboard-stats.php /supplier/api/dashboard-stats.php
cp /tmp/warranty.php /supplier/warranty.php
cp /tmp/orders.php /supplier/orders.php
cp /tmp/reports.php /supplier/reports.php
cp /tmp/account.php /supplier/account.php

# Deploy new API endpoints
cp /tmp/warranty-update.php /supplier/api/warranty-update.php
cp /tmp/account-update.php /supplier/api/account-update.php
```

### Step 3: Set Permissions
```bash
# Ensure proper file permissions
find /supplier -type f -name "*.php" -exec chmod 644 {} \;
find /supplier -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;

# API endpoints may need special permissions
chmod 600 /supplier/api/warranty-update.php
chmod 600 /supplier/api/account-update.php
```

### Step 4: Clear Cache (if applicable)
```bash
# Clear PHP opcode cache
php -r "opcache_reset();"

# Clear application cache
rm -rf /supplier/cache/*

# Restart PHP-FPM
sudo systemctl restart php-fpm  # Or: sudo service php-fpm restart
```

### Step 5: Verify Deployment
```bash
# Test file accessibility
curl https://staff.vapeshed.co.nz/supplier/products.php

# Check for errors
grep -i "error\|fatal" /var/log/apache2/error.log | tail -20
```

---

## ✅ POST-DEPLOYMENT VERIFICATION

After deployment, verify in production:

### 1. Products Page
```bash
curl -b "PHPSESSID=test_session" \
  https://staff.vapeshed.co.nz/supplier/products.php | head -100
# Should return HTML with KPI cards
```

### 2. Dashboard
```bash
curl -b "PHPSESSID=test_session" \
  https://staff.vapeshed.co.nz/supplier/api/dashboard-stats.php | python -m json.tool
# Should return JSON with inventory value
```

### 3. Warranty API
```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -b "PHPSESSID=test_session" \
  -d '{"fault_id": 1, "status": 1}' \
  https://staff.vapeshed.co.nz/supplier/api/warranty-update.php | python -m json.tool
# Should return JSON response or 403 if not authorized
```

### 4. Error Logs
```bash
# Check for new errors
tail -50 /var/log/apache2/error.log
# Should be clean (no new errors)
```

### 5. Performance
```bash
# Monitor response times
ab -n 100 -c 10 https://staff.vapeshed.co.nz/supplier/products.php
# Should complete without 500 errors
# Response time should be < 2 seconds per request
```

## 🚨 ROLLBACK PROCEDURE

If anything goes wrong in production:

### Quick Rollback (< 5 minutes)
```bash
# Restore from backup
BACKUP_DATE=$(date +%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S | head -c 19)
cp -r /backups/production/$BACKUP_DATE/* /supplier/

# Restart PHP
sudo systemctl restart php-fpm

# Verify
curl https://staff.vapeshed.co.nz/supplier/products.php
```

### Full Rollback (if needed)
```bash
# Contact: IT Manager
# Procedure: Restore from daily database backup + file backup
# Timeline: 15-30 minutes

# Notify suppliers during process
# After restore, test all PHASE 1 pages
```

- Fix: Restore from backup and re-deploy

**Issue: "Dashboard shows $0.00"**
- Check: Database has products with supply_price > 0
- Fix: Verify data integrity, may need data correction

**Issue: "Can't update warranty claims"**
- Check: Session is valid, supplier_id matches
- Fix: Create support ticket, may be permission issue

**Issue: "Reports page looks weird"**
- Fix: Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
- Try: Different browser

## ✨ WHAT SUPPLIERS WILL NOW SEE

### Products Page
> "I can see which of my products are selling fast, which are slow, which have quality issues, and where I have excess inventory. This helps me plan production and inventory better."

### Dashboard
> "Dashboard shows accurate inventory value - I know exactly how much stock I have on hand worth."

### Warranty
> "I can track defect rates by product and see which items have quality issues most frequently."

### Reports
> "Date ranges work properly, I can run reports for specific periods to analyze trends."

### Account
> "My account information is validated properly, preventing accidental data entry errors."
